## About
This project is designed as a battery-powered system. It utilizes the RTC module to periodically wake up the STM32 from low-power mode, allowing it to perform measurements and obtain weather data via the ESP8266 (which also makes use of its low-power mode) using the OpenWeatherMap API.

The retrieved data is displayed on a 1.3″ OLED screen. A user button allows switching between different displayed information.

The project is mainly motivated by educational purposes, but with future potential improvements it can become practical and useful device.

## Software Used
- STM32Cube
- Visual Studio Code
- Logic (Saleae)

Libraries, frameworks, APIs:
- STM32CubeHAL
- Arduino for ESP8266 (PlatformIO)
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Hardware Used
- STM32L476RG (Nucleo-L476RG)
- ESP8266 (NodeMCU-V3, ESP-01S)
- Logic Analyzer
- DHT22 (temperature/humidity sensor)
- LPS25HB (pressure sensor)
- 1.3″ OLED display (SH1106 driver)
- Wires, Resistors, Capacitors

## Hardware Connections
During the prototype phase, development boards are powered via USB ports. Therefore, all components and MCUs are powered through the onboard voltage regulators.

## Installation
1. Flash the ESP8266 firmware:  
   - The STM32 communicates with the ESP8266, which requires a separate firmware.  
   - Follow the instructions in the [ESP8266 repository](https://github.com/Romwierz/esp8266-weather-station-wifi-module) to flash the appropriate code. 
2. Clone this repository using Git command:
    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Romwierz/weather-station.git
    ```
- Alternatively, download the ZIP and extract it.
3. Open **STM32CubeIDE** and open the project:
    - Go to **File** → **Open Projects from File System** → **Directory...**
    - Select the project folder and **Finish**.
4. Open the `.ioc` file and generate the code using the **Device Configuration Tool Code** from the toolbar.
5. Build and run the project.
